# SudeT - Steam User Data Extraction Tool

This tool was created as a proof of concept for extraction of locally stored Steam user data. It provides functionality for extracting Steam files as well as parsing .vdf files to display useful data for forensic investigations. The current scope of SudeT is very small, and has not been intensively tested. Use at your own risk.
